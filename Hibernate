Data source - Driver,connection ,username and password 
Dialect - version of DB the above mentioned data needs to be informed to Hibernate/JPA

How to Intract with Hibernate :
1.needs to written in hibernate.cfg.xml,datasource,dialect,whic pojo classes ,pool and caching

  1.identify hibernate.cfg to which particular database provider it connecting is called configuration
  2.Standard service register builder , build the configrtion 
  3.session factory ,session is works only with primary coloum value it is mandatory to communicate with data for storing deleting ,updating etc , Unique ID is primary key ,
  session(pk) -->query API(HQL) which apply restriction to database (i.e)without working with primary key
  transaction (JTA) , commit transaction ,close session  and finally close factoy
