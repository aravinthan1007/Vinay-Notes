JAVA EE - Enterprise solution 
HTTP - is light weight , stateless,fasterst protocol 
Stateles - HTTP don't remember the data ,Broweser remeber , inorder to change from stateless to stateful method we are using servlet or JSP menthod 

HTTP Method :
Get request - get uphend the inormation in the end of the url, size limitation, get the information fom the server , GET is used
Post Request - it would't send at the end of URL , browser payload o send the data to application, it will split part by part, creation of something post request is used
put/patch - Partial modification patch is used and coplete modification put is used 
Delete - delete the request 
head - used for meta information - like browser version , call was made of 
trace - trace the valid client 
option - Dopdown used 

Type (HTTP Method)
- Meta infomtion - request header - information about client and data 
-data - information 

response - content type(text/html/image )
status code - varios are status code of HTTP - https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
Architecture pasted in the issue in Githb for reference 

CGI - is traitional method , CGI improves the hardware part and it is not part of the Multithreading 
Servlet API - uses Multi threading concept 
Life cycle of servlet :
1)Void init(servlet config)
2}void service(servletrequest,servletreponse) - what exactly servlet need to do, process and respone preformed here 
3)void destroy()

Servlet Hierarchy:
Generic servlet - it handle anyother protocol
Httpservlet - Http specific in place of service method , put,post ,delete is child of generic servlet 
Void service(httpservlet response, httpservlet request)
void doget(httpservlet response, httpservlet request)
void do post*httpservlet response, httpservlet request)
void doput(httpservlet response, httpservlet request)
above mentoned are HTTP related services 

JVM - work with OS to implement the multi threading , Each and every OS has mlti threading
