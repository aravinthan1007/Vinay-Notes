JEE as three container - JSP,servlet and EJB container is to load and execute the life cycle of the container 
 JSP (Java Server page):
 Problem statement 1- you have reistration page with multiple parameter , lot of data entry fields , Servlet can't display error message next to tab or data , servlet activated with url not with the UI
 problem statement 2 - display complete database of ID's we need to write lot of boliler plate of code , servlet not good for presentation layer 
 JSP is combination of servlet and HTML , internally it's converted into servlet 
 JPS as tag for everything , servlet is used for secure page , JSP is not secured as servlet , so all business layer in the servlet 
 Architecture of JSP :
 controller -  incoming request goes it view.jsp and model.java(pojo class)
 JSP Life cycle :
1. Translation stage  - translated to servlet(.java)
2. JSP init()
3._jsp service() - Method can't be over written 
4.destroy()- Garbage collection- clean the inactive service 

9 JSP Implicit objects ( Predifined object in JSP)
1.request - servletrequest 
2.response - servletresponse 
3.out - JSP writer like out.println(servlet)
4.config -servletconfig 
5.application - servletcontext 
6.session - httpsession 
7.page - object - visible only in particular JSP page 
8.Exception - throwable 
9.pagecontext - capablity add,read ,modify and remove attribute 

JSP Tags:
Scripting Tags - used for communication,printing,logic 
JSP Directives 
JSP Action tags
Comments tag 
custom tag or user defined tag

Scripting Tag 
1)Declaration Tag -<%! int x=5;%> - class level or global level or common to all object 
2)Expression Tag - <%="Hello"%> - printing result or Expression , Servlet send some date into JSP, using this tag servlet message printed in the HTML box
3)scriplet Tag - <% all logic service %>


Form creation using scripting tag :
step 1: create the form tag with action = "">
Step 2: enter name , input type is text 
step 3: input =submit and click 
step 4: create JSP tag to validate above click using if(click != null) that means it click
step 5:print the result of above if class with request.getparameter("fname")

JSP Directive :

<%@%>
<%@page%>
<%include%> - include some page include tag is used
<%taglib%> - refering the custom tag , helpful for import all the tag in particular folder

Demo JSP Directive :
<%=<h1>Hello for JSP @ +new date()%>"</h1>" - it will import the java util 
Exception handling in JSP 
Step 1 : Create new JSP page as error 
step 2 : declare @page iserrorpage ="true"
step 3: print the error message using span or out.print with style as Error occured<%=exception%>
step 4: get back to the execution page <%@page errorpage =Ã«rror.jsp> and <%@page iserrorpage ="true"%>

Action Tags:-Dynamic operation in JSP 
difference between @include directive  - is include the response in the translation phase itself 
<Jsp:inclue> in action tag - converts the response only and only if required when application is running
