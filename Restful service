Web services - W3 suggested the SOAP (XML) - Promblem is XML bulk for the complex application, reduce the speed of the application 

Rest is Architecture style - Roy finding suggested --> web service uses HTTP -->rest run on the HTTP formate appliction is simple xml, supported JSON , Localy understood by the server,html and text
https/http -put,get,delete,post, status code/mesage updated here . 

Rest is URL based and endpoint(URI or /welcome or/index)

Rest Implementation :
JAX-RS-->(Jersy API )
Spring Rest 

What makes a restful API?
Rest Architectural constrains - 6 Constrains 
1.unifrom interface -Cosistent Approach - uri should be meaningful and not complicated
2.client-server - existing as ifferent thing clint and server
3.statelessness - intraction between client and server should be setless , No client context should be stored in server , client need manage the state of it , if server maintained over the client session  it will make  the server busy and bulk data
4.Cacheing - Temporary memory -reduce number of call to database or server,- caching in server - reduce call to database , - caching i client-reduce call to server 
5.layered system - Avoid thing to client about how datastored, authendication works 
6.Code on demand - Source code shared to client , 

Postman - used to test the rest endpoint 

Get is for DB and Load is for Cache 

Front Controller - Come at one and exit at same point:
Jersey API to request to servlet container to classes again servlet to respone to Jersey API
